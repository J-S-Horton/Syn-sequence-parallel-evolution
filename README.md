# Syn-sequence-parallel-evolution
This repository holds all the novel scripts written for data analysis of the manuscript: "A mutational hotspot that determines highly repeatable evolution can be built and broken by silent genetic changes" by J. S. Horton et al.

Users are welcome to download and utilise these scripts for purposes of academic scrutiny.

The MATLAB script 'hybrid_glnl_pfl01_0340_seq' requires the .csv file 'syncodons2' to execute. The .csv file is also available in this repository for download.

The 'hybrid_glnl_pfl01_0340_seq' script was used to determine the percentage of nucleotide differences between two loci of equal length that are non-synonymous. This is completed by comparing the sequence output "seq" from the pipeline to the ancestral sequence "glnl" using Nucleotide BLAST with default parameters.
